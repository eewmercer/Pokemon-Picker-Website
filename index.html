            <h2>IT'S TIME TO BEGIN</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every generation of pokemon has begun with you, the trainer, choosing between
                three different pokemon before starting your journey. These three types include
                grass, fire, and water; each one is unique to it's respective generation, and you
                get the chance to pick whichever one you prefer. 
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this can sometimes be a difficult choice to make, so this site is here
                to help inexperienced trainers, like yourself, pick your first starter pokemon. Each 
                one is unique in it's own way, and it's an adventure in itself just exploring the different
                traits in order to make your choice. For the sake of simplicity, we will be viewing
                3 main base stats of these starters:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Offense Builds</li>
                <li>Defense Builds</li>
                <li>Speed Builds</li>
            </ol>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each will be grouped into one of these categories, 
                and each will be considered based on their final evolution so you can consider 
                the future growth of your life-long partner. Let the adventure begin!</p>
